## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

5 components to ggplot2 grammar:
Layer- geometrical or statistical visual pieces
Scales- ways to demonstrate magnitude of variables, plus legends and axes
A coord, or coordinate system- what you'd expect
Facet- Ways to group the data on the chart(s)
Theme- House style

Packages the book reccomends for exercises are included in the setup section of this markdown


Ex 2.2.1
1. List five functions that you could use to get more information about the mpg dataset.

Glimpse
Summarise
Tidyr group by (then summarise)
Histogram
Boxplot

2. How can you find out what other datasets are included with ggplot2?

Read the documentation/vignette. > help(package=ggplot2)


3. Apart from the US, most countries use fuel consumption (fuel consumed over fixed distance) rather than fuel economy (distance travelled with fixed amount of fuel). How could you convert cty and hwy into the European standard of l/100km?

Take the reciprocal of the function to convert to fuel per fixed distance. Then multiple by appropriate conversion rates to move to metric units.

4. Which manufacturer has the most models in this dataset? Which model has the most variations? Does your answer change if you remove the redundant specification of drive train (e.g. “pathfinder 4wd”, “a4 quattro”) from the model name?
For most models, Toyota: mpg%>%dplyr::group_by(manufacturer)%>%summarise_each(funs(n_distinct),model)%>%arrange(model)
Model with most variations, Caravan 2WD: mpg%>%dplyr::group_by(model)%>%count(model,sort=TRUE)
Remove redundant specification, using Regex to remove anything after first space, answer is Audi: mpg%>%dplyr::group_by(model)%>%mutate(model=sub(" .*", "", model))%>%count(model,sort=TRUE)

#Three key components to a plot
Data, self-explanatory
Aes, what relationships you are exploring (autoname to x then y)
Geom, how you are visually representing them

One line per element is best practise for easy to read code, with a + in between as ever.



#Exercise 2.2.1
1.How would you describe the relationship between cty and hwy? Do you have any concerns about drawing conclusions from that plot?
Strong positive linear relationship as per graph.Slight evidence of heteroskedasticity and some minor outliers. From a GGplot2 standpoint the point Geom doesn't handle duplicates well, add in a jitter to better capture clustering around 'duplicate' values.
```{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
#above two lines markdown boilerplate from https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/figures-side.html
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty,hwy))+geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty,hwy))+geom_point(position = "jitter")

```
2. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show? Is it useful? How could you modify the data to make it more informative?

It shows the model names against the manufacturer names and is as good as useless due to the unintelligible x axis.To make more informatice I would swap the axis and y axis. This still isn't a great graph, but it presents the information asked for in the question. MOdifying the data by removing the extraneous drive specification also helps.
```{r, out.width="100%"}

ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(manufacturer, model)) + geom_point()

mpg2<-mpg%>%dplyr::group_by(model)%>%mutate(model=sub(" .*", "", model))
ggplot(mpg2, aes(manufacturer, model)) + geom_point()



```
3. Describe the data, aesthetic mappings and layers used for each of the following plots. You’ll need to guess a little because you haven’t seen all the datasets and functions yet, but use your common sense! See if you can predict what the plot will look like before running the code.

ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point()
mpg data, cty on x and hwy on y, points used

ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_point()
Diamonds data set, mapping relationship between carats and price. Points used

ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy)) + geom_line()
Economics data set, unemployment over time, line graph

ggplot(mpg, aes(cty)) + geom_histogram()
Mpg, histogram of city miles per gallon.


```{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
#above two lines markdown boilerplate from https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/figures-side.html
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point()

ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_point()

ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy)) + geom_line()

ggplot(mpg, aes(cty,hwy)) + geom_point(shape='star')



```
 
To change the colour, shape, or size, put inside the aes call itself and set equal to how you want it to be specified.
To simply set these aesethetics for aesthetic reasons add in the geom_point (for example) call instead.



# Exercises 2.4.1
1.Experiment with the colour, shape and size aesthetics. What happens when you map them to continuous values? What about categorical values? What happens when you use more than one aesthetic in a plot?

Continuous variables are better done with colour or size, discreet variables are better done with colour or shape. This corroborates the arguments made in the textbook. Using more than one aesthetic compiles, but leads to nonsenical results.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price))+geom_point()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, colour=cut))+geom_point()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, colour=depth))+geom_point()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, size=depth, colour=table))+geom_point(alpha=0.1)


```


2.What happens if you map a continuous variable to shape? Why? What happens if you map trans to shape? Why?

A continous variable can't be mapped to shape. This make sense as otherwise it would require as many shapes as unique values in the dataset.

If Trans is mapped to shape the graph compiles as the number of discrete non-duplicates is less than the number of possible shapes. It isn't a great data visualisation however, as the data clusters at points, making the graph impossible to interpret.Note that there are a maximum of six shapes allowed per visualisation as per warning.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, cut, shape=price))+geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy, cty, shape=trans))+geom_point()


```


3.How is drive train related to fuel economy? How is drive train related to engine size and class?

Jitter added in due to duplicate values. Front wheel drive has the best fuel economony overall, then four wheel drive is better, although rear wheel drive can be more efficient than four wheel on the highway.

The graph probably gets too complicated when including three variables. Rear wheel is for small cars with big engines, front drive is for most cars with smaller engines and four wheel drive is for big offroaders. A graph only it's coder could love. Clear motivation provided for the use of faceting.


```{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty,hwy, colour=drv))+geom_point(position='jitter')
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, class, colour=drv))+geom_point(position = 'jitter')

```
To add faceting for graphs, you just need to add +facet_wrap(~variableName) for the variable which you would like to facet by.

# Exercises 2.5.1

1. What happens if you try to facet by a continuous variable like hwy? What about cyl? What’s the key difference?

Typo here, hwy is discrete not continous (at least mathematically). It facets a large amount, leading to a difficult to interpret graph. Cycle is better as it leads to a clearer to interpret graph. From this one can see that it is better to facet on fewer points rather than more.

```{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty,drv))+geom_point()+facet_wrap(~hwy)
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty,drv))+geom_point(position='jitter')+facet_wrap(~cyl)
ggplot(mpg,aes(hwy))+geom_histogram()
```
2. Use faceting to explore the 3-way relationship between fuel economy, engine size, and number of cylinders. How does faceting by number of cylinders change your assessement of the relationship between engine size and fuel economy?

As engine size increases fuel efficientcy decreases. Number of cylinders is greater as the engine size increases.
Faceting doesn't change my assessment, but it does show much clearer evidence of clustering by cylinder size.


```{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ,cty, colour=cyl))+geom_point(position = 'jitter')+scale_color_continuous(trans='reverse')
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ,cty, colour=cyl))+geom_point(position='jitter')+facet_wrap(~cyl)+scale_color_continuous(trans='reverse')
```

3.Read the documentation for facet_wrap(). What arguments can you use to control how many rows and columns appear in the output?

nrow and ncol are the arguments to control this

4.What does the scales argument to facet_wrap() do? When might you use it?

Scales determines if the scales should be a fixed size throughout. Given the default is fixed, this parameter would be used when you want to vary the scale size.
